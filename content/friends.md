From time to time I will come to the friends who have turned over the chain of friends. Some of the old friends' domain names or websites may be temporarily removed if they fail. Please leave a new site information ~ (no order in the following rankings)

## Want to be listed here?

If you'd like to be added to this friends page, please send me the following information:

1. Your name/nickname
2. URL to your website
3. A square avatar image (at least 100x100 pixels)
4. A short description or slogan (keep it under 50 characters)

You can contact me via email at [your.email@example.com](mailto:your.email@example.com) with the subject "Friend Link Request".

I typically add new friends within a week of receiving your information.
