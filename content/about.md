Welcome, and thanks for stopping by.

I'm **Lahrasab**, a curious mind navigating between technology and creativity.

A full-stack developer, tech enthusiast, and an observer of systemsâ€”whether it's code, people, or how things work.

By day, I work in **vehicle tracking and fleet management**, ensuring efficiency and safety with AI-powered monitoring systems. By night, I tinker with **Go, HTMX, and Tailwind**, crafting clean, efficient web applications.

In daily life, I delve into backend technologies (such as Go and microservice architecture), while also dedicating myself to frontend development and user experience design. I continuously learn the latest development tools and methods, and try to apply them to personal projects to improve efficiency. My academic and leisure interests revolve around technological innovation, which not only enriches my knowledge base but also helps me grow in team collaboration and project management.

Feel free to reach out if youâ€™d like to discuss projects, collaboration opportunities, or just share insights. You can check out my detailed resume and portfolioâ€”available in both Chinese and Englishâ€”via the links below.

Feel free to leave a messageâ€”I might not reply instantly, but I always read.
