## Hello World!

This is my first blog post using Hugo and the PaperMod theme. I'm excited to start sharing my thoughts and experiences here.

### Why I Chose Hugo

Hugo offers several advantages that made it perfect for my needs:

- Incredibly fast build times
- Simple and straightforward setup
- Flexible content organization
- Great theme ecosystem

### Setting Up My Site

The process was surprisingly easy. After installing Hugo, I just needed to:

1. Create a new site with `hugo new site myblog`
2. Add the PaperMod theme
3. Configure the `config.yaml` file
4. Start creating content!

### Code Example

Here's a simple example of a "Hello World" program in Python:

```python
def greet():
    print("Hello, World!")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    greet()
