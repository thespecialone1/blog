# Electronics Sales Analysis: From Raw Data to Dashboard Insights

Working with another dataset, this time focusing on electronics sales across different regions and product categories. The goal was simple: turn rows of transaction data into something that actually tells a story.

## The Dataset

Starting with basic transaction records:
- Order IDs and dates
- Product details (name, category)
- Regional information
- Sales figures, quantities, and costs

Added a month column to make trend analysis easier. Sometimes the simplest additions make the biggest difference.

## Key Findings

**Overall Performance:**
- Total sales: $243.5K
- Units sold: 477
- Profit: $210.7K
- Year-over-year growth: 14%

**Regional Insights:**
The West and South regions are driving most of our revenue. East and North are lagging behind, which raises questions about market penetration or customer preferences in those areas.

**Product Performance:**
Monitors and mice are standout performers. Interesting to see accessories like mice competing with big-ticket electronics. Headphones and keyboards show potential but need deeper analysis.

**Seasonal Patterns:**
The monthly trend reveals some volatility throughout the year. 2024 shows more consistent performance compared to 2023's peaks and valleys.

## Technical Approach

Built this using Excel's pivot table functionality combined with calculated fields for the key metrics. The dashboard layout focuses on the most important KPIs upfront, with supporting visualizations below.

**Dashboard Components:**
- Performance cards showing key metrics with year-over-year comparisons
- Monthly revenue trend line chart
- Regional sales distribution (horizontal bars)
- Product-wise sales breakdown (column chart)

## What This Reveals

The 14% growth is encouraging, but the regional disparities suggest untapped opportunities. The product mix shows we're not just selling expensive items and accessories are pulling their weight too.

The monthly trends indicate we're getting more consistent, which usually means better forecasting and inventory management.

## Next Steps

This analysis raises more questions than it answers, which is exactly what good data exploration should do. Why are certain regions underperforming? What's driving the accessories success? How can we replicate the West region's performance elsewhere?

That's where the real work begins.
