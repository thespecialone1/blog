Lately, I’ve been diving into Excel not just as a spreadsheet tool, but as a platform for storytelling through data.

I wanted to build something that wasn't just a collection of raw numbers, but something visual and interactive dashboard that actually **says something**. This project started as a quiet experiment and turned into a solid learning experience.

## Step-by-Step Process
1. **Data Cleaning**  
   Imported raw sales data, removed duplicates and outliers, standardized date formats.  
2. **Dashboard Design**  
   Structured worksheets, built PivotTables for key metrics, and arranged elements on a clean canvas.  
3. **Dashboard Design**  
   Polished visuals, added slicers and charts, tuned layout for clarity and flow.

## Key Insights from the Dashboard
- **Sales Trend**: September spikes to \$28.7K, with a steady rise from mid year.  
- **Top Categories**: Chairs lead at roughly \$59.6K, followed by Bookcases.  
- **Shipping Modes**: 54% of orders use Standard Class, while First Class accounts for ~19%.  
- **Delivery Times**: 25% of orders arrive in 4 days; over 60% delivered within 3–5 days.  
- **Regional Performance**: New York drives ~\$58.6K in sales, with Pennsylvania and Ohio trailing.

I found some inspiration from a concise walkthrough online that showed just how powerful and surprisingly simple Excel can be when used intentionally. That nudge helped me shape my own workflow and gave me the momentum to take it further.

## Conclusion
This dashboard taught me that **simplicity beats clutter** and that good visuals start with good data. PivotTables proved their value, and a clear layout made insights pop. Next up: exploring light automation and perhaps a touch of interactivity.
